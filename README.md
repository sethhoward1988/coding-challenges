Coding Challenges
=================

This repository represents various coding challenges that I've been presented with over the years. Each time that I interview for a position and they send me a coding challenge, I will store my response as well as the challenge here.

Hopefully in future interview, they can just go look at how I handled these tests instead of sending me an endless number of tests. Or maybe if they happen to send me the same test, ie "fizzbuzz" then I can just pull from here instead of writing it over and over again. Granted, FizzBuzz takes like 2 seconds to write, it might prove more useful for ones that took an hour to accomplish.
